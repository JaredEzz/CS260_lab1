        are great at what they do and easy to work with. I was nervous about being filmed and looking or feeling
        awkward. They are both very friendly and help you feel at ease during the filming process."

        "Ivory Lane has done videography and photography work for me. They are so talented! I love their creativity,
        lighting and camera angles they use in their work. They're also very fast on the turn around- they had my photos
        done the next day! I would Reccomend this company for weddings, graduations, family photos or anything. You will
        be so pleased with their work!"

        "We recently went through Ivory Lane Media for all of our wedding needs. Not only did they have amazing pricing
        that fit within our budget, we were able to get our engagement photos, bridal photos, wedding day photos,
        wedding videography AND our wedding floral through them!! They really know how to listen and capture everything
        in the moment. They are so fun and build a great foundation with you during the entire process creating a new
        friendship. Everytime we were all together it was always filled with laughing and loads of fun!! I highly
        recommend them!!"
